1. There are available number of hotels but they are too much in numbers. Large number of hotels are decreasing the beauty of the sea beach and the city space.

2. Most of the hotels are not so affordable to stay.

3. During the vacations, the sea beach gets over crowdy which of course ruins the beautiful environment with the scenario.

4. There are many local photographers who stays around the beach and advertise themselves to gain attention of the travellers, but they are not always doing what you want and also they will charge you for every photos they've taken with many being clicked in the same angle.

5. Local restaurants are not so cheap. They cost more than anyones budget on lunch/dinner.

6. There are no danger-zoned line mapped on the sea beach for which it often becomes very risky to enjoy the waves of the ocean and to dive on thoes.
